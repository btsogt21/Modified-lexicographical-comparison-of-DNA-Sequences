# Function that takes in list of dna sequences and list of
# index pairs (i, j) and outputs whether or not s_i is
# lexicographically less than s_j for each index pair. 
# Output is in form of list of booleans. Caveat that if 
# len(s_i) < len(s_j), s_i < s_j will evaluate to True.
# However, if len(s_i) is not less than len(s_j), then
# lexicographical comparison will occur as normal. 
# For example,

# 'AG' < 'AAA' will output as 'True' when put through our
# function as 
# len('AG') < len('AAA') despite the fact that, purely
# lexicographically, 'AG' < 'AAA' should output 'False'.

# However,
# 'AAA' < 'AG' will also output as 'True' given that
# len(s_i), in this case, is not less than len(s_j), and
# purely lexicographically, 'AAA' < 'AG' would output 'True'

# len(s_i) > len(s_j), then s_i < s_j evaluates to 'False'
# regardless of what purely lexicographical comparison
# would output. That is, 'AAA' (s_i) < 'AG'(s_j) would 
# output 'False' as len('AG') < len('AAA'), even though,
# purely lexicographically, 'AAA' < 'AG' would output as
# 'True'.
